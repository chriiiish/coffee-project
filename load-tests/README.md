# Load Tests
Load tests are done using Locust (https://locust.io/)

These are python tests. As such you will need to setup a virtual python environment by following the instructions here:
https://programwithus.com/learn-to-code/Pip-and-virtualenv-on-Windows/

Then activate your virtual environment by running:
```powershell
.\env\Scripts\activate
```

Then install the required dependencies:
```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
