# coffee-project
A serverless coffee ordering system for the office

## History
A long time ago in a company far-far-away there once was a hackathon which spanned a day.

The challenge for the team, noble and true, create a system to manage the coffee ordering for team meetings, a few.

With version one we learnt git, deployment, angular and more. The project succeeded and there were prizes galore.

Now with the rise in the adoption of cloud, it is time to try something audacious and loud.

Version two, serverless be! Let no operating systems for us to manage be seen!

A complete DevOps pipeline we shall need, with stages for testing (load and security!)

And hence why this project exists - for serverless coffee and testing the limits.

## Goal
The goal here is to have a complete DevOps pipeline - but in order to test that pipeline we need to have something to test it with!
Queue this project.

## To Get Started
1. Clone the repo
2. Run dev_start.ps1 in a powershell window (run it from the repository root). This will setup the python virtual environment for the tests
